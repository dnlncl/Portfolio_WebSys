                        <p>My name is Deniel Nicole Salcedo but everyone calls me nics or nicole. I am currently a second year college student at Rizal Technological University and I am studying Bachelor of Science major in Information Technology.

                            My current hobbies are very simple: watching films, playing games, listening to music, singing, and making crafts/art. I am also very passionate in writing. Whenever I finish watching a film or series, I always go to letterboxd to rate them and write down my reviews or thoughts. Writing short poems is included also, in fact, I have a hundreds of poem that I wrote on my notes app.
                            
                            Life, solitude, dreams, and admiration are the one's that I write about, but most the time, my muse has always been myself and the other people that are dearest to me. That is because I am a firm believer that I am just a fragment; a mosaic of everyone I've ever loved, even for a heartbeat.
                            
                            And this site is a compilation of all the fragments that completes and define me. I'll show you around!!</p>

                        <p>Photography, for me, is all about capturing moments that often go unnoticed. I love how a single photo can tell a story, evoke an emotion, or freeze a fleeting moment forever. Whether it's the play of light at sunset, the small details in nature, or candid expressions of people, I find myself drawn to the beauty in everyday life. Through my camera, I get to explore the world from different perspectives, and each shot becomes a way of expressing how I see and experience life.</p>

                        <p>Watching films is my favorite pastime. It is a ritual that enriches my life in countless ways. It is where I experience a myriad of emotions and perspectivesâ€”narratives that are new but familiar to me. Films that are intricate is what defines me the most; audaciously bold but subtle.</p>

                        <p>Writing has always been my passion since I was little. It gives me clarity to write down my thoughts and articulate it into something that I will understand. For it never forced me to open up and say the things that I will regret later on, perhaps, it brings me a profound feeling where I can freely rewrite, reflect and undo the words that is uncertain to me.</p>
